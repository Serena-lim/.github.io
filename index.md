## 📊 Data Sources and Project Ideas

### 1. Federal Reserve Economic Data

[CPI](https://data.cdc.gov)
[Inflation,  consumer prices](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA)
[Unemployment Rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)
[GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1)

**Project Idea 1:** How have Inflation, Unemployment, and GDP evolved in the United States from 2000–2024, and how do major economic crises (2008 and COVID-19) appear in these indicators?
**Project Idea 2:** What is the relationship between inflation (CPI) and unemployment in the United States

### 2. Walla Walla Climate Data  
[Link](https://www.weather.gov/wrh/timeseries?site=KALW)

**Project Idea 1:** Are there consistent daily patterns in temperature changes within the three-day period?
**Project Idea 2:** How did changes in temperature relate to changes in humidity or wind speed over the three days?

### 3. Population Growth Rate  
[Link](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-growth-rates )

**Project Idea 1:** How has the population growth rate changed over time in the United States? What key factors help explain these trends?
**Project Idea 2:** Comparing population growth between two countries

### 4. Average Years of Schooling  
[Link](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mean-years-of-schooling-long-run)

**Project Idea 1:** Is higher average years of schooling associated with lower fertility rates across countries?
**Project Idea 2:** Is there a relationship between average years of schooling and economic development (GDP per capita)?
**Project Idea 3:** How does gender inequality in education (male vs female years of schooling) vary across regions, and how has it changed over time?

### 5. Child Mortality Rate 
[Link](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality)

**Project Idea 1:** How have child mortality rates changed over time in different countries?
**Project Idea 2:** What is the relationship between child mortality and economic development (e.g., GDP per capita)?

## Above and Beyond

As an Above and Beyond, I included another project I did this semester on Covid-19 Deaths in the United States.

### Overview
This report uses the dataset “Provisional COVID-19 Deaths by Sex and Age” published on October 16, 2025. It aggregates provisional counts of Covid-19 deaths in the United States by sex, age group, year (from 2020-2023), and location (states). 

### Visualization 
**Findings:** 
Covid-19 mortality was substantially higher for males than females in 2020-2022; by 2023, deaths declined steeply for both sexes.
Mortality risk rose sharply with age, especially among those 65 years and older.
